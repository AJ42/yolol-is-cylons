**Note: the title must start with `[Question]` and the issue must have the label `Developer Question` or it will be removed!**

A question submitted with this template will hopefully be answered by a developer of the game in the near future. Once answered, the information will be brought over to the repository so everyone can share in the knowledge.

And keep the questions focused on yolol! We may remove your question at any time without warning if it's deemed to not follow the rules, though we will alert you.

Add any additional details for the question here, as well as maybe a thanks to the devs ;)
